Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
    Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers.  The plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance.  Artemis Financial wants to modernize their operations.  Part of this is updating their software to use the most current and effective software security to protect their client data and financial information.
    
What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
  Coding securely is of paramount importance for several resons, and it adds signigicant value to a company's overall wellbeing.  Some of the key reasons why software security is crucial are as follows.  Secure codeing practices help protect sensitive and confidential information.  Companies that prioitize software security build trust with their customers.  Many industries have regulations and compliance requirements related to data security and privacy.  Investing in secure coding practies can help prevent security vulerabilities and breaches.
   
What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
   Since this was my first oppertunity to work with many of the different parts of vulnerability assessments I found everything that we worked with very helpful and extremely informitive.
   
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
   By running vulnerability assessments and ensuring that the dependincies that were being used were up to date was the main technique that I used to add security.  As of right now I would use the same techniques that we used in this class, I do feel that I would need more practice with cybersecurity prior to 
   feeling completely confident in my abilities though.
   
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  By reruning the dependency checks to ensure that all of the changes that were made did not introduce any more vulnerabilities.
  
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  As of right now I am not sure what would help me in future assignments because I do not know what those may be.  I do know that ensuring that I follow secure coding practicies and making sure that any dependencies that I use are up to date will help with any projects that I may work on.
  
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
  It would depend on the position that I was applying for. All of the positioins that I have currently been looking at are looking for skills that were not used in this class and showing them anything that I would show them from this class would seem like a waste of time.  However if I were to apply for a job that was looking for skills that were used in this class then I would try to single out the parts of the class that was relevent to the position.
